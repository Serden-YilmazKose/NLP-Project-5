All tasks are found in the NLP-course-project.ipynb file.
Tasks like 10. and 12. take a long time to run. The cost of corrections in task 10 are saved in corrections.csv file so the code for it doesn't need to be ran again.

Needed Python libraries:
nltk
numpy
sklearn
pandas
json
itertools
statistics
matplotlib
scipy
vaderSentiment
pprint
seaborn
empath
gensim
torch
transformers
random
spellchecker
os

Also, in Task 10, Nvidia CUDA was used to enable GPU support for training and utilizing our doc2vec model.
